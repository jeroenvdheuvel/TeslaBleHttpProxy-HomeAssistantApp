name: "TeslaBleHttpProxy"
description: |-
  TeslaBleHttpProxy is a program written in Go that receives HTTP requests and forwards them via Bluetooth to a Tesla vehicle. The program can, for example, be easily used together with evcc.

  The program stores the received requests in a queue and processes them one by one. This ensures that only one Bluetooth connection to the vehicle is established at a time.
