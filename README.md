# Home Assistant TeslaBleHttpProxy Application

The [TeslaBleHttpProxy](https://github.com/wimaha/TeslaBleHttpProxy)
allows for connecting and managing your Tesla vehicle via Bluetooth.
The official TeslaBleHttpProxy can't be installed as a Home Assistant
Application.

This repository aims to solve that while staying close to the official
application.
